# Fire Prediction
Using Machine Learning to predict fire risk across Canada


## Disclaimer
The goal of this project is to analyze historical fire data in Canada to predict the risk of fire (high, medium, low) in a given region. Please note that this model is not intended for use as a fire risk advisory. For official fire risk information, please consult resources such as local weather advisories or [weather alert](https://weather.gc.ca/) provided by Environment Canada.
